Slife is an activity browser for the MacOS X. When the Slife client runs, it observes as you interact with applications, documents and web sites in your computer. It keeps track of when and for how long you work on projects, read news, check email, etc.

It's a perfect tool for anyone who needs to keep track of time for billing purposes and is used by thousands of consultants, designers, writers and many others all over the world.

Slife offers several visualizations that makes it easy to identify when you work and what you do in your computer. You can create "Activities" to categorize your computer tasks and even set goals for yourself (i.e. "spend only 20 minutes a day watching online videos").

Slife Labs brought the v2.x generation of the Slife client to open source and continues to maintain it with help from the community. Slife v3.0, the most recent version of the application is now available on the web at http://www.slifeweb.com. Please note that while the Slife source code is available here under the GPL license, it relies partially on code snippets from other authors, under other licenses.
